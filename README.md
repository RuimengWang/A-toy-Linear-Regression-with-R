# A-toy-Linear-Regression-with-R for quantities finance starters
There will be a large file that includes everything(Just like a Goulash, or Chinese-hotpot, called "Final.txt"), and many components of the big file. 

In this project, I will use R programming to finish a toy linear regression analysis to an excel dataset. I decided to write this because two of my friends meet huge problems when they just start their career as quants in VC and they just know nothing about R. The R code that their boss give them are poorly organized and would be very hard to be used as references. 

This is an R-program. There is an integrated one as well many components. 

For more details, please refer to these two books:
1. Julian Faraway. Linear models with R. 
https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Models-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1584884258
2. http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/
3. Chinese book: 汤银才：R语言与统计分析

Something not useful for you:
As an experienced technical entrepreneur(I started my first high-tech startup when I was 20), I really know the significance of using qualitative methods in finance. But I also believe that, for finance, that is a not merely a method to make money. You should take finance as a method to boost the economy and the society. As a technical guy I am gladly to assist you with programming and mathematical tricks. 

And please remember, in your future career, assist those technical startup entrepreneurs, just like me. Finance is not merely a tool for you to become rich. 

It would be extremely useful for those who just start their career as a quantity financial analyst to use my code. Another part of quantitive finance is monte carlo modeling. I will provide you with another file about how to use monte carlo in many fields, from physics modeling to quantitive finance.

I think it is possible to use this code for: 

1. Quantitive finance
2. Economic research
3. Linear regression models for data mining&machine learning
4. Social computing
5. ...

All the best for your career and life. Good luck for your career, and remember, to assist those technical entrepreneur.
