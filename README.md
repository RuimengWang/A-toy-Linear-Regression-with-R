# A-toy-Linear-Regression-with-R
In this project I will use R programming to finish a toy linear regression analysis to an excel dataset. I decided to write this because two of my friends meet huge problems when they just start their career as quants in VC and they just know nothing about R. The R code that their boss give them are poorly organized and would be very hard to be used as references. 

It would be extremely useful for those who just start their career as quantitve financial analyst to use my code. Another part of quantitive finance is monte carlo modeling. I will provide you with another files about how to use monte carlo in many fields, from physics modeling to quantitive finance.
